
-- Participant
--------------

Participant having a PS number equal to the PS number of the local bank (PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4) will be flagged as 'Un-transeferred Participant' by default
then 'Transferred Participant' by users when this one was initialy followed by the local bank then followed by another bank.

Participant having a PS number diferrent than the PS number of the local bank (PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4) can only be flagged as 'Transeferred Participant'. This property defines 
participant who was intialy followed by another bank then followed by the local bank.

Exception exists for participants that have been previously created into the ATiM 'Processing Site' (to record samples received from all banks and stored into PS3 site 
for orders and projects). These participants have been migrated by script in January 2018 from ATiM 'Processing Site' to the ATiM of the PS3 bank and flagged 
as 'Un-transeferred Participant' into this PS3 ATiM when the PS numbers of these participants were different than PS3.

In all cases additional data like consent, treatment, etc can be linked to the participant but for the exception defined above a message will inform user that no additional 
participant information is supposed to be recorded.

-- Collection
-------------

A collection can only be created from participant using ClinicalCollectionLink functions.
Exception exists for 'Control' collection that has been created by ATiM Update Script (SQL) and can not be deleted or linked to a participant.

A clinical collection link can only be deleted when no sample is linked to the collection and process will delete automatically the collection.

-- Sample
-------------

Sample created by system to migrate aliquot from ATiM-Processing site can be used as parent sample when at least one aliquot exists for this sample into the ATiM
used (this one is the aliquot previously transferred from bank different than PS3 to 'Processing Site' and now merged into the ATiM of PS3).
Sample created by system to migrate aliquot from ATiM-Processing site can not be be edited.

-- Path Review
--------------

A path review can only be created for a sample created by system to migrate aliquot from ATiM-Processing site when at least one aliquot 
exists for this sample into the ATiM used (this one is the aliquot previously transferred from bank different than PS3 to 'Processing Site' 
and now merged into the ATiM of PS3).

-- Quality Control
------------------

A quality control can only be created for a sample created by system to migrate aliquot from ATiM-Processing site when at least one aliquot 
exists for this sample into the ATiM used (this one is the aliquot previously transferred from bank different than PS3 to 'Processing Site' 
and now merged into the ATiM of PS3).

-- Aliquot
-------------

An aliquot of a sample created by system to migrate aliquot from ATiM-Processing site and defined as created by another bank than the bank of the ATiM used (aliquot previously 
transferred from bank different than PS3 to 'Processing Site' and now merged into the ATiM of PS3) can only be deleted when:
 - no other aliquot is linked to this sample.
 - no derivative is linked to this sample.
 - no quality control is linked to this sample.
 - no specimen review is linked to this sample.
 
A new aliquot can be created for a sample created by system to migrate aliquot from ATiM-Processing site and defined as created by another bank than the bank of the ATiM used when 
at least one aliquot is still recorded for this sample (aliquot previously transferred from bank different than PS3 to 'Processing Site' 
and now merged into the ATiM of PS3)

An aliquot of a sample created by system to migrate aliquot from ATiM-Processing site and defined as created by another bank than the bank of the ATiM used (aliquot previously 
transferred from bank different than PS3 to 'Processing Site' and now merged into the ATiM of PS3) can not be defined as the children of an aliquot (realiquoting definition).
