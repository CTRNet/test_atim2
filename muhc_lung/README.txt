ATiM is a Biobank Information Management System (BIMS) designed and developed by
CTRNet and the CRCHUM in conjunction with the canadian biobanks for the operation 
of biobanks. 

-- Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Canadian Tissue Repository Network (CTRNet) is a non-profit association of 
Canadian tissue biorepositories that aims to support health research using human 
biospecimens through initiatives that improve and promote access, quality, 
and standardization in biobanking. 

Part of CTRNet’s strategy to achieve this goal has been to participate to the 
development of the Advanced Tissue Management software (ATiM), a Biobank 
Information Management System (BIMS) in collaboration with the CRCHUM. 

ATiM was designed and developed by CTRNet and the CRCHUM, in conjunction with 
canadian biobanking experts, to support biobank operations.
