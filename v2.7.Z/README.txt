ATiM is a Biobank Information Management System (BIMS) designed and developed by
CTRNet (http://www.ctrnet.ca/) in conjunction with Canadian biobanks for the 
operation of biobanks. 

-- Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Canadian Tissue Repository Network (CTRNet) is a non-profit association of 
Canadian tissue biorepositories that aims to support health research using human 
biospecimens through initiatives that improve and promote access, quality, 
and standardization in biobanking. Part of CTRNetâ€™s strategy to achieve this goal 
has been to create Advanced Tissue Management (ATiM), a Biobank Information 
Management System (BIMS). ATiM was designed and developed by CTRNet, in conjunction 
with Canadian biobanking experts, to support biobank operations.
