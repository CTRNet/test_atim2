1. beforeFilter() function migration
	ATiM 1.6
		- each controller (ex. /clinicalannotation/controllers/participants_controller.php) 
			in each plugin contained the beforeFilter() function
	ATiM 2.0
		- the beforeFilter() function has been removed from each of the controller and moved 
			to the plugin app controller (ex. /clinicalannotation/clinnicalannotation_app_controler.php)
		- the contents of the function should follow the following format:
			- function beforeFilter() {
				parent::beforeFilter();
				$this->Auth->actionPath = 'controllers/<pluginName>/';
			  }
				note: <pluginName> should be replaced with the plugins actual name

2. /study/views/study_ethics_boards/ folder name is changed to /study/views/study_ethicsboards/

3. study_related database table must be changed to study_relateds due to naming conventions in cake 1.2
